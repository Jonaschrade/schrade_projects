Rowing Ireland has the responsibility to develop and maintain a culture of safe practice to advise all our clubs that they can support everyone involved in the sport in their efforts to achieve this.

All decisions regarding safety at rowing clubs and rowing events should be based on risk management as no safety document can possibly cover all situations. By continually assessing likely risks and taking action to manage them, some generalised standards can be developed, enabling us to provide guidance on how to avoid and take action regarding unforeseen hazardous situations.

All clubs have a responsibility to provide information, education and training about safety to their members. Individual members also have a responsibility to find out, learn, question and implement safety best practice. It is essential that all clubs register their members with Rowing Ireland to ensure full cover for all members. In addition, clubs need to take into account their own local risks and should conduct risk assessments regularly.

Having safety in mind at all times is an important part of what it means to be a club member.

Determining a website's platform involves a few simple techniques. Begin by right-clicking on the webpage and selecting ""View Page Source."" Look for clues within the code, such as comments mentioning specific platforms (e.g., ""Powered by WordPress"") or file paths indicating particular systems. Alternatively, use online tools like BuiltWith or Wappalyzer, which analyze a website and identify its underlying technologies, including the CMS, frameworks, and server-side languages. Browser extensions like Wappalyzer offer real-time platform detection. Remember that some websites may intentionally obscure this information, so complete accuracy isn't always guaranteed.

In this video, I run a training session which is 10 x 4 minutes with 45 seconds of rest between each interval.

I start with the pick drill for a quick warm-up to ensure your technique is established correctly. 

In the video I discuss,

1) Make sure that EVERY MOVEMENT you are making is helping your boat or wheel move faster.

2) Drills to help with upper body preparation on the recovery.

3) How to apply power on the drive.

And more.!!!

I begin with a 5 minute pick drill so that you warm up appropriately before the main training session. 

This is a low-intensity session, aiming for around 70% of maximum heart rate.

The session is 3 x 9 minutes with 1:30 rest between intervals. I will take you through this training session, discussing the following points:

1) Always row with control and precision.   
2) float on the slide, relaxing during recovery, especially during the last part.
3) Good recovery mechanics are essential for a well-executed drive.
4) How to row an effective stroke to make your force curve a haystack.
5) Drop the rate if you need to stay within your heart rate zone, but don't sacrifice force application and form.

Full blog here: https://www.coachbergenroth.com/rowing-video-analysis-enhanced-in-app-video-capture-feature/

I’ve been eager to develop this functionality for some time. The primary aim is to enhance rowing video analysis with real-time force application feedback. By integrating force curve data directly onto recorded footage, users can view their technique in slow motion alongside crucial performance metrics, enabling detailed analysis of both technique and force application.

Previously in my workflow, video review and force curve analysis were separate processes. This latest update in the Coach Bergenroth app’s beta version revolutionizes this approach. Now, coaches and athletes can record their technique and simultaneously view metrics such as elapsed time, power, and drive length, with the force curve data superimposed on the video.

To use this feature, simply connect the app to a Concept2 Ergometer’s PM5 using the standard procedure. A camera icon is positioned in the top right of the metrics view. Tap this icon, position your device so your profile is in the camera’s view, and press the record button on the top left of the screen. If prompted, allow the app to record your screen.

During your training session, the app captures everything displayed on the screen. A green “recording” indicator confirms that the process is active. After completing your session, press the stop icon next to the recording button to end the capture.

A preview window will pop up, allowing you to save the recorded session to your device’s photos. This feature captures all 17 metrics, facilitating simultaneous data collection and video analysis.

Full blog here: https://www.coachbergenroth.com/rowing-video-analysis-enhanced-in-app-video-capture-feature/

I’ve been eager to develop this functionality for some time. The primary aim is to enhance rowing video analysis with real-time force application feedback. By integrating force curve data directly onto recorded footage, users can view their technique in slow motion alongside crucial performance metrics, enabling detailed analysis of both technique and force application.

Previously in my workflow, video review and force curve analysis were separate processes. This latest update in the Coach Bergenroth app’s beta version revolutionizes this approach. Now, coaches and athletes can record their technique and simultaneously view metrics such as elapsed time, power, and drive length, with the force curve data superimposed on the video.

To use this feature, simply connect the app to a Concept2 Ergometer’s PM5 using the standard procedure. A camera icon is positioned in the top right of the metrics view. Tap this icon, position your device so your profile is in the camera’s view, and press the record button on the top left of the screen. If prompted, allow the app to record your screen.

It would be better if the force curve was truly real-time, so that the video could be slowed down and you could directly see biomechanics and the effect on the force curve.

I like the fact that you can see stroke length in the video as well.  Might be helpful to pinpoint technical issues.  I don’t know.  I’m just tinkering really. 

I could probably invent a lot of really cool stuff, if I didn’t have so much grading to do, but life is full of choices.

Bobbie left the Olympic champ in the dust—earning herself a pair of socks, a new fan, and a whole lot of respect.

Impressed by her raw speed and talent, Michael reached out to the school’s Rowing Manager. That moment kickstarted something incredible. Bobbie was soon invited to cox at the NZ Beach Sprint Championships at Orewa Beach, racing alongside New Zealand’s elite—including Olympic gold medalist Emma Twigg.

And it didn’t stop there. When Emma couldn’t cox, Bobbie stepped up to lead the King’s College U17 coxed quad sculls team—bringing home gold! 🥇

Then came a surprise twist: Mike and Bobbie discovered they both whakapapa to Ngāti Porou and are actually distant cousins! 🧬💫

From a car park race to national medals and unexpected family ties—this is a story of speed, spirit, and serendipity.

In this video, you'll follow along on board a mixed masters 2x boat.

This video will be quite interesting for those of you who usually
do erg only. Be it at home, at the crossfit box or at your favorite
gym as it will cover a whole rowing event.

Rowing the boat to the start line, the umpire boat and signals,
the usual trouble when many different boat classes start at the
same place, navigation around the turnaround buoys, crosswinds,
headwinds, not so perfect rowing conditions and so on...

preparing intervals for extensive warmup followed by a 4 minute time trail. give all you've got - your peak performance


This video is suitable for any rowing machine, as it is a timed workout. In the video, you'll find an target intensity column. If you are an experienced rower, you might work with intensity based on your 2k time. If you are a beginner, watching your heart rate is a good way of monitoring the overall stress put on your body during a workout, in this case use the percentage column as heart rate zone target. I.e. the blue 60 - 70 % indicator suggest you to row in the 60-70% range of your (estimated or tested) maximum heart rate. A heart rate monitor is highly recomended. In the past chest straps were the only way to reliably measure HR. Recently a few products came to market which would work on your arm too (i.e. Polar OH1)

The SPM box shows a target stroke per minute range. Keep in mind to watch your form and correct sequence even at higher stroke rates. Use the low SPM ranges to closely look at what you are doing through the full sequence.

The Resilient Rower - How to Prevent and Manage Rowing Injuries

Greg Kerr from Horizon Physiotherapy hosted the third Hour of Power of the year - a fantastic presentation called 'The Resilient Rower'. Greg is a highly experienced rower and physiotherapist, and is the clinical director at Horizon. The workshop drew around 30 participants and covered common rowing injuries, how to avoid them in the first place, how to manage them once they've appeared, and how to optimise training and technique to stay healthy and pain-free. Among other things, we learned about why Greg likes to see 'fishing rod' posture in rowers, why we should be paying way more attention to the Thoraco Lumbar Fascia, and why the 'Kerr Squat' should be considered as a part of everyone's warmup routine. Huge thanks to Greg for sharing his time and expertise with us.

Miltä kuulostaisi vuoristoharjoittelu ilman matkustamista, eristäytymistä pitkäksi aikaa hotellihuoneeseen tai vuoristossa ylös-alas-liikkumista? Entä ainutlaatuinen mahdollisuus säätää harjoittelun, elämisen ja nukkumisen korkeutta nopeasti harjoitusohjelman tai palautumistilan mukaan kehittymisen optimoimiseksi? Kuopiossa se on mahdollista edulliseen hintaan, keskellä yliopistokaupungin palveluita ja erinomaisten harjoittelupaikkojen läheisyydessä.

Vuonna 2013 valmistuneessa talossa oleva hyväkuntoinen kaksio, josta on rakennettu vähähappinen alppimaja. Vuokrataan kalustettuna. Asunnossa on pyykinpesukone, astianpesukone ja pienet kodinkoneet.
 
Asunnon vähähappisuus vastaten korkeutta merenpinnasta on säädettävissä seuraavasti:
Olohuone & keittiö 0-3500m
Makuuhuone 0-4000m
WC ja sauna 0-3500m
Saunan alppiteltta -8000m
Sohvaan integroitu paineentasauspussi omalla maskilla -8000m
Huoneiden välillä mahdollisuus säätää noin 1000m korkeusero. Haluttu korkeus asettuu huoneesta ja lähtökorkeudesta riippuen 1-24h kuluessa. Talvisin vastaavat korkeudet hieman matalammat. Sauna ei ole käytettävissä saunomiseen, mutta siellä tulee varmasti lämmin. Saunan alppiteltta on nostettavissa 5000m korkeuteen alle tunnissa. 

Seuraavat harjoitusvälineet neuvoteltavissa:
Wattbike Pro
Concept 2 soutulaite
Concept 2 Ski erg
Concept 2 Bike erg
Rogue Echo bike

Asunto mahdollistaa sujuvan valmentautumisen hyödyntäen muun muassa seuraavia menetelmiä:
Live high, train high
Live high, train low (asunnon ulkopuolella)
Live high, train high and low
Live low, train high
Intermittent hypoxic (interval) training

Today, I want to talk to parents who are new to rowing—especially if your child is considering joining a junior rowing program this fall.

Here’s what most parents don’t realize: the learning curve in rowing is steep. And when your child is one of 30 kids at tryouts, knowing how to handle the rowing machine, how to pace, how to row with proper form—that matters. Bad technique creates injuries and slow progress. My coaching prevents that.

I teach kids how to hold the handle to avoid blisters, how to condition their bodies before rowing starts, how to visualize the stroke, and how to self-correct. This isn’t just about being fit—it’s about being ready.

When your child shows up at tryouts already rowing efficiently, it’s like walking into class already knowing the answers. Coaches notice. Your child’s confidence soars. And you—the parent—know you gave them the best possible start.

If you want your beginner high school rower to be prepared this fall, let’s talk. Go to eliterowingcoach.com or book a call with me. Let’s make rowing a sport your child thrives in.

By Xeno Müller | Olympic Gold & Silver Medalist | Elite Rowing Coach

Let’s say it plainly: kids change—and they change fast.

As obvious as that sounds, you’d be surprised how often it’s overlooked in sports coaching. Especially in junior athletes, where the goal is long-term development, not short-term dominance.

A Rowing Coach’s Reality: The Athlete Today Is Not the Same as Yesterday
As a rowing coach—and this applies across tennis, swimming, gymnastics, and every sport that involves grace, timing, and physical progression—I've witnessed firsthand how puberty isn't just physical growth. It’s a recalibration of the entire system: bones, muscles, tendons, brain chemistry, psychology, and even diet.

One day your rower seems powerful and balanced. The next, their timing is off, their patience is low, and they’re frustrated. This isn’t regression. It’s growth in disguise.

The Hidden Tug-of-War: Bones, Muscles, Tendons, Brain
When young athletes grow, they go through a biomechanical balancing act:

Bones lengthen.
Tendons and muscles struggle to catch up.
Flexibility changes.
Neuromuscular pathways need to be re-learned.
Their body isn’t betraying them. It’s reorganizing itself. Coaches who don’t recognize this mistake temporary misalignment for lack of effort or discipline.

And here’s the deeper layer: the brain has to remap movement patterns.

That’s why something that “clicked” last week suddenly feels clumsy. It’s not mental laziness—it’s neurological recalibration. As a coach, you either adapt to this... or you burn out your athletes.

The Iron Truth for Girls, and the Risk of Overload for Boys
Female athletes often face dietary deficiencies during key growth years—iron being one of the most common. Without proper iron levels, oxygen delivery drops, fatigue increases, and performance suffers.

This isn’t fixed with a motivational speech—it’s fixed with awareness, communication, and action.

Meanwhile, boys often mask insecurity in the gym. They chase numbers on the squat rack, deadlift beyond their limits, and forget that technique and patience build lifelong athletes—not ego lifts.

Both situations can lead to injuries, and worse, a loss of love for the sport.

What Every Rowing Coach—and Every Coach—Must Do
Listen first.
Adapt every day.
Accept non-linear progress.
Fuel smartly.
Talk about physiology openly.
Empower with education.
We coaches are not just timekeepers or drill masters. We are interpreters of change, guides through adolescence, and advocates for health over hype.

As a rowing coach, I don’t just analyze split times—I observe body mechanics, emotional tone, energy, focus, and patterns of change. That’s how I help rowers win seat races, improve erg scores, and—most importantly—stay in love with the process.

Your Athlete is Not a Machine. They’re a Miracle in Progress.
To every parent reading this: give your child grace.

To every athlete: be patient with your body and brain.

To every coach: pay attention, and keep learning.

In my own Olympic journey, I saw that the best performances came not from brute force, but from learning how to listen—to my body, my coach, and the feedback that mattered most.

Change is not the enemy. Unacknowledged change is.

Let’s coach for growth, not just results.

As a former Olympic rower and now an elite rowing coach, I want to share my personal experience and a call for awareness around a persistent and overlooked issue in the rowing world: upper respiratory infections (URIs) and the way we respond to them as athletes and coaches.

Athlete Mentality vs. Medical Reality

Rowers are trained—almost indoctrinated—to be tough. Push through pain. Show up no matter what. We’re told that unless we’re running a fever or bedridden, we train. That mentality can get you far in competition, but it can also take you straight into a doctor’s office… with a wheeze.

I’ve been there.

During my competitive years, I remember developing an upper respiratory infection. I did what many rowers do instinctively: blew my nose hard, tried to cough my way to clear lungs, and refused to miss training. But here’s what happened instead:
 • Sinus infection from blowing too hard
 • Secondary pulmonary infection from prolonged coughing
 • Antibiotics prescribed
 • Wheezing severe enough that I was given a bronchodilator (which, by the way, is only permitted out of competition)

The medical advice I received early on lacked crucial context. It didn’t include cautions about rest, recovery timing, or the risks of pushing through a URI. It wasn’t until I trained under one of my Olympic coaches that the guidance changed.

What My Olympic Coach Taught Me

He had seen it too many times. His response was swift: “Start antibiotics immediately.”
Why? Because, in his experience, the longer we wait, the more likely the illness morphs into a deeper infection. Athletes often cough themselves into worsening conditions—bronchitis, pneumonia—when early rest and targeted treatment might have prevented that entirely.

His philosophy was shaped by years of observing rowers lose weeks of training (and even entire racing seasons) because they didn’t pull back soon enough.

What I See Now as a Coach

Today, I work with high school rowers and club athletes. And I see the exact same pattern.
 • Clubs tell kids to train unless they have a fever.
 • Winter training is often indoors, with poor ventilation.
 • Athletes are lined up on ergs, sweating and breathing heavily—while others are coughing, sniffling, and clearly sick.
 • One sick athlete becomes five. Five become ten.

What’s worse is that the culture still rewards showing up sick. The “tough-it-out” mentality is celebrated while coaches fail to recognize the long-term consequences—both to the individual and the entire team.

Post-COVID Immunity Gap?

Here’s a theory I’ve been tossing around (as a coach, not a doctor):
During the COVID lockdowns, we had less exposure to common viruses. Kids weren’t swapping germs like usual, and for a few years, we saw very little illness. Now, with everyone back in close quarters, we’re seeing more severe URIs than before. It could be an immunity lag. It could be bad luck. But one thing is for sure:

Coughing too hard, blowing too hard, and training through upper respiratory issues is not a sign of grit. It’s a recipe for long-term damage.

What Coaches Need to Do
 1. Stop glorifying the “just show up” mindset. If your athlete is coughing, wheezing, or visibly struggling to breathe, they should not be erging next to healthy teammates.
 2. Educate your rowers—especially the young ones—on how to recover properly. Rest isn’t laziness. It’s recovery.
 3. Create clear protocols for sick athletes. “No fever = show up” is not enough.
 4. Separate the sick from the healthy in indoor training settings, especially during cold and flu season.
 5. Recognize that training through illness weakens the team. You might feel like you’re helping them build toughness, but in reality, you’re trading short-term appearances for long-term resilience.

⸻

This message is for every coach and every rower who has tried to “row through” a cold.

Let your lungs heal. Let your team stay healthy.
Being tough is about knowing when to stop just as much as it is about knowing when to push.

If this resonates with your experience—or if you’ve seen these patterns in your own club or team—I’d love to hear your story. The more we bring this issue to light, the faster we can change the culture around training and recovery in rowing.

This message is for every coach and every rower who has tried to “row through” a cold.

Let your lungs heal. Let your team stay healthy.
Being tough is about knowing when to stop just as much as it is about knowing when to push.

If this resonates with your experience—or if you’ve seen these patterns in your own club or team—I’d love to hear your story. The more we bring this issue to light, the faster we can change the culture around training and recovery in rowing.

Most people see this as a piece of an old oar. I see a scalpel, a precision tool. If you're rowing in college right now, congratulations, you made it through the recruiting gauntlet. Your erg score got you in. But guess what? That erg score won't move you from the 4V to the 3V or from the 2V to the 1V. Seat racing will, and seat racing is all about one thing: blade work. How you place it, how you extract it, how clean you are, how you blend into the rhythm without disrupting it and still add speed. That's where that scalpel comes in. I've trained with the best coaches in the world. I've won Olympic gold and silver in the single scull. My final 500-meter sprint is still the fastest ever recorded, 1:36.56. And everything I learned came down to one principle: Refined blade work wins races. But there's the problem. If you're in college, trying to climb the ranks this summer, there's no camp for you. All that's left for you to do is erg more, erg work. No one teaches you about the handle movement, how the blade responds to the handle movement. Yet, the erg replicates that handle movement. And if you do it wrong, your blade work will stay no good. And so maybe some people are lifting, but no one's guiding you through the blade precision that actually wins seat races.

The truth about erg speed versus boat speed, and why it matters, especially for recruiting. I'm XENO Olympic gold and silver medalist in the single scull, recruited to Brown University as the top US prospect and the most trusted online rowing coach for high school athletes who want to get recruited. Let me explain a big, big misunderstanding in rowing. A fast erg doesn't mean you move the boat fast. I've seen it again and again, athletes who destroy the erg, but don't win their seat races. And why is that? Well, because the rowing machine forgives bad technique. You can yank the handle, the flywheel will spin. But in the boat, speed only comes if the blade enters and exits the water at the right time. That's where many rowers fall apart. Now, here's something parents rarely hear. Lighter rowers with the same flaws as heavier rowers will move a boat faster, simply because they disturb the water less. Bigger athletes with technical flaws do more damage to boat speed, but recruiters don't see boat-moving ability. They see erg scores. And that's why I coach both. I teach Olympic-level efficiency that works on the erg and translates into the boat. Because the right stroke is the same stroke. It's the timing, the rhythm, the connection, and I've mastered how to teach that. No rowing camp, no rowing camp does this consistently. Camps don't have the time or the depth of knowledge to correct what truly matters. I was trained by the best. I've won at the highest level, set an Olympic record, and now, I help rowers win their seat races and get recruited. Win their seat races, get recruited.

I was running a rowing workout for a group of dedicated individuals in their 60s and 70s. I’m certainly the younger one in the bunch, but what we shared today transcended age—it was about presence, precision, and something I can only describe as flow.
We were using our water-resistance rowers, which already add a timeless quality to the experience with their soothing, rushing sound. As we began warming up, I guided the group through an intentionally technical sequence—focusing on nasal breathing, on keeping the shoulders relaxed and hanging from the neck, and on narrating each stroke internally.
This kind of self-narration—describing to yourself what you are doing, why you are doing it, and how—is one of the greatest tools I know. It’s how I trained for the Olympics. It’s how I race. It’s how I win. And more importantly—it’s how I find joy in the movement, regardless of the stakes.
What happens when I combine this internal narration with nasal breathing is nothing short of a switch being flipped. Even if I woke up feeling sluggish or unmotivated, the moment I begin this process—the breath, the sequence, the awareness—I enter a flow state. The breathing acts like a cleanse. The technical focus sharpens the blade of movement. And then—everything flows. Legs stretch the spine, the fingertips hang, the stroke becomes a reach, a glide, an elegant surge.
And then, the sound.
That’s when I told the group: “What you hear in the drum of your WaterRower—that swoosh—that’s the sound of something ancient. The sound of water being moved has been around since before we were. It’s the same sound you might’ve heard from a little stream cutting through a valley a million years ago.”
It was one of those moments where time stops.
I went on, “Think about the sound of a crackling fire… or a rock falling onto another rock. These are primal sounds. Ancient sounds. And we’re making one of them—by rowing. By accelerating water with our bodies. That’s poetry in motion.”
At that moment, we weren’t just exercising. We weren’t ‘getting a workout in.’ We were present. We were part of something bigger. We were escaping—not running away from anything—but escaping into something: focus, rhythm, breath, movement.
It’s amazing what happens when you let your breath cleanse your thoughts. When your mind has space to wander and find patterns. When your focus doesn’t feel like a chore, but a release.
By the end of the session, I was energized—not just physically, but mentally. I was ready to make better decisions. To stay composed in a world that moves fast. And most importantly, to carry this sense of rhythm and presence into the rest of my day.
If you’ve never experienced this kind of rowing, I encourage you—no matter your age—to try. It’s not just a workout. It’s a pathway to clarity. #rowing #coaching #meditation #innerpeace",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jNWOZ0nqMjo/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jNWOZ0nqMjo/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jNWOZ0nqMjo/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jNWOZ0nqMjo/sddefault.jpg,640.0,480.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jNWOZ0nqMjo/maxresdefault.jpg,1280.0,720.0,Xeno Muller Online Elite Rowing Coach,17,none,Olympic Gold Medalist’s Path To Meditation Through Rowing Movement,"Today, something truly remarkable happened.

If you’ve never experienced this kind of rowing, I encourage you—no matter your age—to try. It’s not just a workout. It’s a pathway to clarity. #rowing #coaching #meditation #innerpeace",,PT3M44S,2d,hd,false,False,rectangular,87,4,0,0,,,

Traditional rowing camps often lack the personalized attention and technical mastery that rowers need to improve their ERG scores and reach their full potential. Xeno Muller, an Olympic gold and silver medalist, has designed a solution called the at-home elite rowing camp that outperforms traditional camps by providing exclusive one-on-one Olympic level training in the rower's home or club environment. This training approach eliminates the issues of lack of focused coaching, unnecessary volume training, and environments that don't maximize learning that rowers often face at traditional camps. The at-home elite rowing camp is structured for serious rowers who want to train smarter, not harder, and directly addresses what college rowing coaches look for in recruits.

Rowing Camp

The Power of Perseverance: A Rower’s Reflection


As I was walking home from Starbucks with my wife, I had an epiphany. We were talking about perseverance, happiness in work, and what it really means to develop as a person. My wife rowed in high school, so rowing is a familiar subject for her—let alone the fact that she’s been married to me for nearly 30 years!

And in that moment, I felt this overwhelming need to commend those who dedicate themselves to the sport of rowing.

To the high school rowers who show up day in and day out, pushing themselves through fatigue, bad weather, and the never-ending pursuit of technical precision—I see you.
To the college rowers who commit another four years to moving in perfect synchrony, even when they know not every boat will win—I salute you.

What rowing does for character development is nothing short of extraordinary.

Rowing: A Sport Like No Other

Rowing is a physical sport. But it’s not just physical—it’s relentless.

Most sports demand endurance. But in rowing, every fiber of your body is engaged all at once. You don’t get breaks, you don’t get time to reset between plays—you are always moving, always flowing, always striving for more.

Rowing teaches us that perseverance is not optional—it is essential.

Rain or shine, cold or heat, we row.
Headwinds, sidewinds, whitecaps—we row.
Blisters on our hands, snot freezing on our faces—we row.

We row because we choose to.

And that choice—to push through the discomfort, to silence the excuses, to find rhythm in the chaos—that is what makes rowing more than just a sport. That is what makes it a life lesson.

Moving as One: The True Power of Rowing

There are plenty of tough sports—wrestling, cycling, cross-country running.
But what sets rowing apart?

Unity.

In an eight, every stroke must be identical. Every rower must feel the boat, feel the rhythm, feel each other’s energy.

Rowing is not just a physical test—it is a test of synchronization, of absolute trust.

You cannot hide in a rowing shell. There is no room for ego, no room for selfishness.

To row is to commit—fully, relentlessly—to something bigger than yourself.

And when you row for four years in high school, and then another four in college, you don’t just come out stronger—you come out changed.

You emerge with an understanding of discipline, of teamwork, of grit—a level of resilience that most people will never experience.

And that, in my opinion, makes rowers some of the greatest unsung heroes in society.

The True Gift of Rowing: Perseverance

If there is one lesson I have taken from rowing, it is this:

Perseverance is everything.

Perseverance distracts you from self-doubt.
Perseverance drowns out negativity.
Perseverance keeps you moving forward when every muscle in your body wants to quit.

When we row, we persevere—not just against other boats, but against ourselves.
We push to win, yes. But even when we’re not winning, we push so we’re not last.

Because to stop, to give in, to let up even a little—that is not who we are.

And that is why I am so deeply grateful for rowing.

Rowing made me who I am today.

It gave me the ability to hold on. To push through. To keep going when the road was uncertain, when the path was hard.

I was blessed with incredible coaches.
I was surrounded by teammates I could count on with my life.
And to this day, I carry those lessons forward—not just in rowing, but in every aspect of my life.

Why We Persevere

We persevere for ourselves—to be the best version of who we can be.
We persevere for our families—because we want to be strong, to be there, to show up for them.

I persevere because I want to be around for my wife until I’m 300 years young—and still rowing.

I persevere because I believe in pushing forward, in striving, in never settling.

And so, to every rower out there—from high school novices to college warriors, from Olympians to masters, and even to those who simply row for the love of it—

I salute you.

Because you are not just taking strokes.
You are not just pulling on an oar.

You are building a life of perseverance.

And that is something truly powerful.

Keep rowing. Keep pushing. Keep persevering.

Because in the end—those who persevere always succeed.

Rowing Camp Myths: Why Working With an Elite Online Rowing Coach is the Missing Link 

When parents think about rowing camps, they picture better performance, refined technique, and a boost in their child’s chances of success. But here’s the truth—not all rowing camps deliver on those promises.

As an Olympic Gold and Silver Medalist and the most successful online high school rowing coach, I’ve seen firsthand the critical gaps in traditional rowing camps. The biggest? Camps completely ignore the connection between erg performance and on-water rowing technique—a link that’s essential for achieving elite results.

🚨 Myth #1: Rowing Camps Improve Erg Scores
Most camps avoid ergs altogether. Why?

They focus only on on-water drills like seat racing or regatta simulations.
Many coaches (and rowers) hate ergs because they brutally expose flaws in fitness and technique.
Without structured erg training—like targeted intervals or aerobic base-building—rowers actually lose progress.
The 2K erg score is a make-or-break metric for college recruitment, yet camps don’t prioritize it.

🚨 Myth #2: Rowing Camps Are Enough for Success
Camps are marketed as the ultimate training experience, but they fall short in key areas:

Limited personal attention: Camps have high coach-to-rower ratios, leaving athletes with minimal feedback.
No elite expertise: Traditional camp coaches can’t match my background of being coached by legends like Steve Gladstone and Harry Mahon.
💡 The Missing Link? One-on-One Elite Coaching

My program bridges the gap between erg and on-water performance. Here’s what makes it different:
1️⃣ Individualized Attention: I work directly with athletes, focusing on their unique strengths and weaknesses.
2️⃣ Erg + Water Connection: My coaching ensures seamless power application across both platforms.
3️⃣ Online Flexibility: Unlike rigid camp schedules, I provide video analysis, tailored training plans, and live feedback anytime, anywhere.
4️⃣ Proven Results: My rowers dominate on the water, smash erg records, and secure spots in Ivy League programs.

🌟 The Bottom Line: Rowing camps offer great experiences, but they leave gaps in development. My elite coaching program delivers measurable results—faster erg times, stronger on-water performance, and recruitment-ready athletes.

⏳ Spots are limited, so don’t wait. If you’re serious about your child’s rowing success, contact me today and let’s unlock their full potential.

When you think rowing camp, think of me—the elite coach who delivers results. Let’s build champions, one stroke at a time. 🏆

Time is precious for high school rowers aiming to get recruited to college. With limited summers to prepare, parents must carefully choose the right rowing camp to maximize their child’s potential. For men’s rowing, the summer before senior year is the final opportunity to submit a recruitable erg score. For women, however, recruiting often happens earlier, making it critical to focus on training during the summers before junior year.

No matter your child’s timeline, choosing the right camp can make all the difference in achieving their rowing goals.

The Freedom and Flexibility of Online Rowing Camps

My rowing camps are online programs, offering unparalleled flexibility. This means rowers can participate from anywhere in the world while balancing other commitments like internships, family time, or personal projects. Participants gain access to high-quality, personalized coaching without having to uproot their schedules.

With an online format, there’s no need to travel to a specific location, giving families the freedom to prioritize other aspects of life while still achieving elite-level training.

Key Questions to Ask When Choosing a Rowing Camp

Not all rowing camps are created equal. Parents should consider the following when selecting the right camp:
 • Does the camp focus on sculling, sweep rowing, or both?
 • Are they helping rowers improve their overall technique or just running physical conditioning drills?
 • Do they include training on mental preparedness and self-coaching skills?

The answers to these questions can help determine whether the camp aligns with your child’s specific goals and needs.

What Makes My Online Rowing Camps Unique?

At my online rowing camps, I provide a personalized, holistic training experience that prepares rowers for success on and off the water. Here’s what sets my programs apart:

1. Flexibility for Families and Rowers

Because my camps are online, participants can train from anywhere while having time to focus on other summer priorities. The program is tailored to their schedule, making it easy to balance elite training with personal growth and other commitments.

2. Conditioning and Heart Rate Training

I teach rowers to understand their bodies and how to train smarter, not harder. Learning to monitor heart rates and recovery is essential for maximizing performance and avoiding burnout.

3. Mental Preparedness and Visualization

Mental focus is critical for rowing success. I integrate visualization techniques and positive self-talk into the training process, helping rowers build confidence and stay calm under pressure.

4. Translating Erg Efficiency to Water Performance

I specialize in connecting rowing technique on the erg with performance on the water. This unique focus ensures that the skills rowers develop during training have a direct and measurable impact in competition.

5. Self-Coaching and Independent Problem-Solving

My programs empower rowers to evaluate their own technique using video analysis, mirrors, and innovative tools like resistance bands. This out-of-the-box thinking teaches participants how to self-correct and grow independently.

Why Your Child’s Training Timeline Matters

For men, the summer before senior year is the last opportunity to submit a recruitable erg score. Missing this window can severely limit recruiting opportunities.

For women, recruiting tends to happen earlier, which makes the summers before junior year especially critical. By focusing on training during these key years, rowers can ensure they’re putting their best foot forward when it counts most.

Is Your Child Ready for My Online Rowing Camp?

My online rowing camps are designed for motivated rowers ready to take their training—and their recruiting potential—to the next level. If you’re a parent interested in helping your child achieve their rowing goals, contact me today to see if they’re eligible for the program.

Don’t let the next summer slip away—invest in your child’s rowing future today.

Because my camps are online, participants can train from anywhere while having time to focus on other summer priorities. The program is tailored to their schedule, making it easy to balance elite training with personal growth and other commitments.

2. Conditioning and Heart Rate Training

I teach rowers to understand their bodies and how to train smarter, not harder. Learning to monitor heart rates and recovery is essential for maximizing performance and avoiding burnout.

3. Mental Preparedness and Visualization

Mental focus is critical for rowing success. I integrate visualization techniques and positive self-talk into the training process, helping rowers build confidence and stay calm under pressure.

4. Translating Erg Efficiency to Water Performance

I specialize in connecting rowing technique on the erg with performance on the water. This unique focus ensures that the skills rowers develop during training have a direct and measurable impact in competition.

5. Self-Coaching and Independent Problem-Solving

My programs empower rowers to evaluate their own technique using video analysis, mirrors, and innovative tools like resistance bands. This out-of-the-box thinking teaches participants how to self-correct and grow independently.

Why Your Child’s Training Timeline Matters

For men, the summer before senior year is the last opportunity to submit a recruitable erg score. Missing this window can severely limit recruiting opportunities.

For women, recruiting tends to happen earlier, which makes the summers before junior year especially critical. By focusing on training during these key years, rowers can ensure they’re putting their best foot forward when it counts most.

Is Your Child Ready for My Online Rowing Camp?

My online rowing camps are designed for motivated rowers ready to take their training—and their recruiting potential—to the next level. If you’re a parent interested in helping your child achieve their rowing goals, contact me today to see if they’re eligible for the program.

Don’t let the next summer slip away—invest in your child’s rowing future today.

One of the most common mistakes I see on the erg is a 𝗹𝗼𝗼𝘀𝗲 𝗴𝗿𝗶𝗽.

𝗟𝗼𝗼𝘀𝗲 𝗴𝗿𝗶𝗽 = 𝘄𝗲𝗮𝗸 𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲.

Ever wonder why the transition from the water to the rowing machine feels off? It's all about the dynamics! 💥

On the water, we draw the boat underneath us with our bodies relatively stationary. But when we jump on the erg, the forces and momentum change completely. The footplate forces are higher, and the dynamics of the catch feel different—sometimes leading to those pesky injuries. 🏋️‍♂️

🧐 Fun fact: A lot of rowers say their back doesn't hurt on the water, but the machine can feel like a whole new world. That difference in force could be the culprit!

Stay injury-free with the right techniques for both! Let’s dive deeper into how you can transition smoothly between the two. 💪

I've been using variations of this exercise more in my strength training for rowers and finding great results. The NHC trains the hamstrings through eccentric knee flexion, as well as the glutes via isometric hip extension. Be aware that this is an undertrained movement in rowing, and the eccentric emphasis can often result in high muscle soreness! Begin with just 3 sets of 5 using a 3-5-second lowering phase, and progress training load gradually from there.

It involves four main phases: the catch, drive, finish, and recovery. At the catch, the rower’s body is forward, with knees bent and arms extended, preparing for the stroke. The drive phase begins as the legs push against the footplate, followed by the body’s torso moving back, and finally, the arms pull the oar through the water. At the finish, the legs are extended, and the oars are fully drawn towards the body. During the recovery, the rower returns to the catch position by extending the arms first, followed by the torso and legs, maintaining a smooth, controlled motion. Effective technique emphasizes proper body posture, rhythm, and timing for maximum efficiency and power.

Headed up by Academy Manager Beck Hamilton, the Academy included 13 of the best sweep trainers in the country.

The Academy conducted its first course commencing in August 2022 for beginner S1 Sweeps, through to S2s/S3s wanting to improve their skills. The academy saw hundreds of new and emerging sweeps, with participants from every state. A combination of online and in person training allowed participants to gain information from different trainers around the country and obtain knowledge and experience to help them in their own sweep improvement. 

Sally Mac has created an incredible video showcasing the amazing efforts of our sweeps academy from last year. If you would like to be a part of our next sweeps academy, head to asrl.com.au and follow us on social media for all the information about our next sweeps academy.

Each season at the Australian Surf Life Saving Championships, it has been our practice in the boat area, to pay our respects to those of the surf boat fraternity who have passed away since the previous season, called the 'Moment of Reflection'

This year, due to the cancellation of the 2020 Aussies, we are acknowledging those who have passed with a video via the ASRL website and social media channels, where we can still pause to quietly reflect on our surf boat mates.

We sincerely thank those who have assisted in providing the information and photos which has allowed us to prepare this presentation. A special mention to Mike Tamblyn ... this is his baby, and we are proud to continue the tradition in the modified format.

Ged rowed six seasons with Wauchope-Bonny Hills SLSC, including Juniors, Reserves and Open Male. This season he rowed with David Luck, Tony Kee, his best mate Mat Bird and they were swept by Manfred Sonntag. The crew name was Full Cassowary, and it was their second season together.

The crew had their best result at state titles this season, finishing in the top eight and missing the Surf Life Saving NSW Open Male Surf Boat Final in the closest of margins, and the crew were planning on making that final in 2021. Recently they held their own end of season rows and held their presentation via social media with Ged and his best mate 'Birdy' holding a mock surfboat race in a wheelbarrow.

Outside of Surfboats Ged was the President of the Wauchope Blues Rugby League Club for four years. He was a champion bloke for only 26 years old and had lived through a lot. His father Dan Roods also a rowed for Wauchope Bonny Hills and passed away in 2006.

Ged was known as an absolute larrikan, full of life, so reliable and an incredible athlete.

Ged is survived by his mother, Karen and siblings, older brother Aaron and younger sister Kristy.

The Australian Surf Rowers League, its members, and the wider surf boat community would like to pass on our condolences to the Roods family, Wauchope-Bonny Hills SLSC and wider Wauchope community.

AN OPEN LETTER BY TONY KEE, dated 12 April 2020

Dear Ged Roods

I have to write this as I can't bring myself to say it out loud. Ive had the privelege to know you for a long time now, we've rowed side by side for several seasons. It's a bit of a crazy sport, old Surfboat rowing.

I've heard it said that life is like Surfboats. We stand on the shore looking out, never sure what to expect but we take it on anyway, side by side. Some times we make it out clean, some times we get swamped and sometimes we catch the wave of the day from the turning cans and hit the beach first. And trust me mate we have done each of those many times!

They say your only ever as good as your last race so you will forever be a champion in my eyes. I dont know how we will ever be the same without you so I remember these words adapted by Wayne Gill which I used this afternoon as the sun sets on this day.

""I must go down to the sea today,
To the lonely sea and the sky.
Where I'll see you again old mate
In a Surfboat rowing by""

I know you'll be out there just over the horizon cracking waves with Buck, Stenno and your dad, Dan. And we all can't wait to see you again but we will cheers to you tonight and remember you forever!

If you are struggling with your sequencing on the rowing stroke (specifically getting your body and handle past the knees on the recovery) the drills in this video will ensure you are rowing properly, allowing you to take your most efficient and powerful rowing strokes, every time.  

In this video, Olympian and Coach, Luke Walton explains the number one issue novice powers face on the rowing machine, and the best drills to correct it. Coach Walton walks you through the body over pause drill (a go to drill for coaches when it comes to correcting issues on the recovery).  He then speaks to his own favorite drill, the arms away pause (which addresses issues on the recovery even better than body over pause).  These drills (together and on their own) will help you to have your most efficient recovery each stroke, and prevent you from running into issues between the rowing machine handle and your knees.

Channel Note:
These videos, taught by Olympian Luke Walton, can be valuable to anyone new to rowing, rowing with a team/club, anyone looking for rowing machine workouts, training for CrossFit or Hyrox competitions, or anyone who who just wants to understand how to row the “rower” (rowing machine) better.
