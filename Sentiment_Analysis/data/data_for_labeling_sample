I'm so busy this weekend that I have no time to cheer up my chronically depressed best friend. All of the activities are mandatory and it makes me look like a jerk.
I don't even know what I'm doing for my birthday.
I get to go home today and I get my new phone today!
This weekend is stressing me out. I have to be up early every morning and I'll be in a hotel room with 5 other people. I feel like I'm going to annoy them cuz I don't know most of them very well. My friend keeps inviting people and I told her I didn't want to go but she says it'll be fun. Can we just fast forward to Sunday pls 😁
I feel weird and empty and sad and happy and wtf what is happening oh god
You get upset when your phone doesn't work and we can't be together and when our time gets cut off because it's one of the most precious things in the world to you. #noonelikeyou
I hate boys as much as I love them. 😁😘
I've never been so tired that much😑😞
I tried not to care today and I almost didn't
I want you so bad. So bad. I miss you.
I get that hes busy. I dont blame him for ignoring me. There are things much more important than me. Im glad hes taking care of himself first. Im not the only mentally ill one i know how tired he is. I understand and thats what makes it so much worse that i still want him to love me.
Urgh when I fall for people I always get so lovey-dovey and cuddly. It is both my strengh and weakness
OMG OMG MUM GOT A JOB OFFER AN HOUR FROM HOME OMG ITS SO CLOSE 
Fish Mooneys makeup in Gotham is so freaking beautiful 💘

Went bra shopping yesterday and now I feel really sad. I can't find my size anymore in primary because I'm to big. Mum says it's what all the girls want but I really don't.

"I wonder what having a relationship is like, can't wait to experience it with someone that I can see having s potential future with, just the thought of it excites me "
I'm also scared ive fucked up
Fucking work my ass off to plan a great weekend for just the 2 of us then you bail to get high and drunk? Are you fucking kidding me? 
"My boyfriend <3 <3 <3 <3 I can't wait to see him again, oh my gosh. I won't say today was perfect, but I had a really good time with him. I really didn't want him to leave. And I probably won't see him for at least a week.... He has exams next week, so he needs to study and he has reports to write. I should take this time to refocus myself as well. "
"Having issues opening the app again. Really hope I can keep accessing it, last time I couldn't was a nightmare."
